## Methods Used
### Top2Vec
Top2Vec (https://github.com/ddangelov/Top2Vec) is an algorithm that simultaneously learns the topic representations and the word embeddings. By mapping documents to a continuous vector space, Top2Vec identifies clusters of documents that share similar themes without requiring a pre-defined number of topics. This approach allows for the discovery of natural and meaningful topics directly from the data.  
  
Top2Vec involves the following steps:  
  
**Embedding Creation:** Top2Vec uses word embeddings to create document vectors.  
**Dimensionality Reduction:** The document vectors are reduced to a lower-dimensional space using techniques like UMAP.  
**Clustering:** The reduced vectors are clustered to identify topics.  
**Topic Words Identification:** The algorithm finds words that are closest to the cluster centroids, representing the topics.  

### BERTopic
BERTopic leverages transformer-based embeddings to create document representations and applies clustering algorithms to discover topics. It combines BERT embeddings with clustering techniques like HDBSCAN and dimensionality reduction methods like UMAP to generate coherent topics from text data.  
  
BERTopic involves the following steps:  
  
**Embedding Creation:** BERTopic uses transformer models to create document embeddings. 
**Dimensionality Reduction:** The embeddings are reduced in dimensionality using UMAP.  
**Clustering:** Density-based clustering algorithm such as HDBSCAN are applied to form clusters from the reduced embeddings.  
**Topic Representation:** The algorithm generates topics based on the clustered documents and their embeddings.
